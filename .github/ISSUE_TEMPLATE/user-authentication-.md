As a user of the website. I want to be able to log in so that I can access my bookings dashboard.

AC1 - Users must enter correct username/email and password.
AC2 - If the credentials are incorrect an error message should appear.
AC3 - On successful login, users should be redirected to the bookings dashboard.
